# Twitch App TODOs

[DONE!] Add in filtering:
    * You can see all the users you follow
    * Filter for live users
    * Filter for the ones that are doing VODcasts
* Add sorting
    * By view count
    * By duration
    * By Game
    * By name
[DONE!] Add messaging that no one is live right now or no one is vodcasting
* Refactor TwitchAPI.js to make it more DRY
